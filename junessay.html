    <p>
        Everyone has most important years in their life, and there are various reasons for that. Some are in the past, <mark>but</mark> others have not happened yet. Today, I will talk about an important year in my life, and it is in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        2026 will be an important year <mark>because</mark> I will turn 18 years old. When I turn 18, I will not be a child anymore. I will have more responsibilities for myself and my family, <mark>and</mark> I will have to start chasing my dream. My dream is to become a web developer, <mark>so</mark> I will need to learn more programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and other languages that can be used to create websites and applications for my future career.
        I will also have  responsibilities for my education. For example, I will need to improve my English to achieve an advanced level,<mark>and</mark> I will have to take the GED test. After that, I will attempt to move abroad.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hence, I have to improve several skills, such as reaching high English level and learning new programming languages. I also have to work hard to achieve my goals and dreams. That is why 2026 will be the most important and meaningful year of my life.
