            Today I want to talk about my friend. Her name is Minji, and she is 22 years old. Even though she is not a teenager, she is childish. I have known her since 2022. We have a really great relationship because we both enjoy lots of the same things. For example, we both listen to music, play games, and count on each other. Although she is my good friend, I don't even see her. She is important to me because she gives me many ideas, listens to my voice, and heals my feelings when I feel down. That's why she is my best and most important friend.

            Good Morning Minji<br>
            <br>
            I hope you're doing well and having nice days. My days are the same as before. You know what? We haven't seen each other for a month. That's because you and I are very busy, and I fully understand that. So I have a plan for us to spend time together next weekend. This plan's to go see a film. I decided to watch a movie called "Ditto". 
            This movie's about a girl called Ban HeeSoo who's having fun with her friends, but it's complicated, interesting and not as simple as you heard. This movie will start playing at 11 AM on Sunday, so let's meet at 9 AM at OMG cafe. If you're not interested, I'll choose other options. That is my plan for next weekend.<br><br>
            If you are interested in my plans, contact me.<br><br>
            Your best friend,<br>
            <u>Xattora</u>
