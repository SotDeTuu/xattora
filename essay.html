    <p>
        Everyone has most important years in their life, and there are various reasons for that. Some are in the past, <mark>but</mark> others have not happened yet. Today, I will talk about an important year in my life, and it is in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        2026 will be an important year <mark>because</mark> I will turn 18 years old. When I turn 18, I will not be a child anymore. I will have more responsibilities for myself and my family, <mark>and</mark> I will have to start chasing my dream. My dream is to become a web developer, <mark>so</mark> I will need to learn more programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and other languages that can be used to create websites and applications for my future career.
        I will also have  responsibilities for my education. For example, I will need to improve my English to achieve an advanced level,<mark>and</mark> I will have to take the GED test. After that, I will attempt to move abroad.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hence, I have to improve several skills, such as reaching high English level and learning new programming languages. I also have to work hard to achieve my goals and dreams. That is why 2026 will be the most important and meaningful year of my life.

            Today I want to talk about my friend. Her name is Minji, and she is 22 years old. Even though she is not a teenager, she is childish. I have known her since 2022. We have a really great relationship because we both enjoy lots of the same things. For example, we both listen to music, play games, and count on each other. Although she is my good friend, I don't even see her. She is important to me because she gives me many ideas, listens to my voice, and heals my feelings when I feel down. That's why she is my best and most important friend.

            Good Morning Minji<br>
            <br>
            I hope you're doing well and having nice days. My days are the same as before. You know what? We haven't seen each other for a month. That's because you and I are very busy, and I fully understand that. So I have a plan for us to spend time together next weekend. This plan's to go see a film. I decided to watch a movie called "Ditto". 
            This movie's about a girl called Ban HeeSoo who's having fun with her friends, but it's complicated, interesting and not as simple as you heard. This movie will start playing at 11 AM on Sunday, so let's meet at 9 AM at OMG cafe. If you're not interested, I'll choose other options. That is my plan for next weekend.<br><br>
            If you are interested in my plans, contact me.<br><br>
            Your best friend,<br>
            <u>Xattora</u>
